Introduction
************
The people around `Open Source Beehives (OSBH) <https://opensourcebeehives.com/>`_ were directing towards audio from the very beginning and therefore presenting coefficients which where won via `machine learning <https://github.com/opensourcebeehives/MachineLearning-Local>`_, learned via the `audio-samples <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/us1633xi4cmtecl/AAA6hplscuDR7aS_f73oRNyha?dl=0>`_ they had so far.

The promising output is simply the activity/health status of a bee colony! So far it can tell whether they are dormant, active, pre-, post- or swarming, if the queen is missing or hatching. For more background information about the audio processing, please follow up reading
`current work status thread in the OSBH Forum <https://community.akerkits.com/t/main-thread-current-work-status/326>`_.

The driving force behind the audio signal processing at OSBH is `Javier Andr√©s Calvo <https://github.com/Jabors>`_, so we want to send a big thank you to him and the whole OSBH team - this program is really standing on the shoulders of giants. Keep up the good work!
